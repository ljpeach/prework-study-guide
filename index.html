          <li>Head elements are largely invisible and primarily serve to provide information about a website to search engines and computers.</li>
          <li>Meta elements contains other information about websites. It is kept within the head element.</li>
          <li>Title stores the title of the page. This can be used for search engine optimization, and unlike other elements held within head, is usually displayed as text on tabs.</li>
          <li>Header elements should be used in order, with h1 being recommended to only be used for the primary title of the page.</li>
          <li>Body elements are responsible for formatting the content on a webpage.</li>
          <li>An element is everything within brackets including the brackets themselves, while tags are what is between brackets.</li>

          <li>External style sheets are written in external files and are linked with the head section using a link element.</li>
          <li>General format is selector {property:value; property:value}</li>
          <li>The same formatting can be specified for multiple selectors by listing them separated by commas</li>
          <li>Classes can be used as selectors to specify special rules for certain elements, but not all of that type.</li>
          <li>Classes are declared by adding a period before the selector in the style sheet. ex: .example {property:value;}</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
