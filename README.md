# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This webpage was built as an intro to the Northwestern Coding Bootcamp, designed to foster familiarity with the various tools that will be used throughout the course. These tools include a CLI, Visual Studio Code, Github, and the developer interface in Google Chrome. The site contains HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and Markdown. Each of these languages hold an important place within web development, and the webpage provides a glimpse into the functionality held within each.
